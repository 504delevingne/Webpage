<strong>"Your Shirt"</strong><br/>
Chelsea Cutler<br/>
<br/>
This time it don’t feel<br/>like you want it all<br/>
Did I do something wrong<br/>to make you go?<br/>
Said I would know when<br/>it's all good to fall<br/>
Now I just need you here<br/>to hold me close<br/>
<br/>
Cause I don't want another <br/>heart to fill the holes<br/>
That you left under my covers <br/>for me to grow cold<br/>
I don't wanna miss somebody <br/>who's not missing me<br/>
But the city feels so <br/>lonely when you leave<br/>
<br/>
My room, where I want you<br/>
Tangled ease in my sheets<br/>
In your shirt that I got you<br/>
Half asleep, holding onto me<br/>
My bed where you left me<br/>
Tangled up, now it's noon<br/>
In your shirt that you gave me<br/>
Half asleep, wishing I still had you<br/>
<br/>
Half asleep, wishing I still had you<br/>
<br/>
This time you said you’re <br/>playing games again<br/>
What are we becoming of it now?<br/>
It's fine, I said, if you're <br/>the one in my head<br/>
Cause I just don't know how <br/>to put you out<br/>
<br/>
Cause I don't want another <br/>heart to fill the holes<br/>
That you left under my covers <br/>for me to grow cold<br/>
I don't wanna miss somebody <br/>who's not missing me<br/>
But the city feels so lonely <br/>when you leave<br/>
<br/>
My room, where I want you<br/>
Tangled ease in my sheets<br/>
In your shirt that I got you<br/>
Half asleep, holding onto me<br/>
My bed where you left me<br/>
Tangled up, now it's noon<br/>
In your shirt that you gave me<br/>
Half asleep, wishing I still had you<br/>
<br/>
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br/>
Ooh ooh ooh ooh<br/>
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br/>
I'm half asleep, <br/>wishing I still had you<br/>
