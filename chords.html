[Intro]
G D Bm A x2

[Verse 1]
    G                       D
This time it don’t feel like you want it all
   Bm                               A
Did I do something wrong to make you go?
    G                          D
Said I would know when it's all good to fall
   Bm                               A
Now I just need you here to hold me close

[Pre-Chorus]
     G                     D
Cause I don't want another heart to fill the holes
         Bm                   A
That you left under my covers for me to grow cold
        G                   D
I don't wanna miss somebody who's not missing me
        Bm                            A
But the city feels so lonely when you leave

[Chorus]
G
My room, where I want you
D
Tangled ease in my sheets
Bm
In your shirt that I got you
A
Half asleep, holding onto me
G
My bed where you left me
D
Tangled up, now it's noon
Bm
In your shirt that you gave me
A
Half asleep, wishing I still had you

[Post-Chorus]
G D Bm A x2

[Verse 2]
     G                           D
This time you said you’re playing games again
Bm                         A
What are we becoming of it now?
    G                                D
It's fine, I said, if you're the one in my head
     Bm                        A
Cause I just don't know how to put you out

[Pre-Chorus]
     G                     D
Cause I don't want another heart to fill the holes
         Bm                   A
That you left under my covers for me to grow cold
        G                   D
I don't wanna miss somebody who's not missing me
        Bm                            A
But the city feels so lonely when you leave

[Chorus]
G
My room, where I want you
D
Tangled ease in my sheets
Bm
In your shirt that I got you
A
Half asleep, holding onto me
G
My bed where you left me
D
Tangled up, now it's noon
Bm
In your shirt that you gave me
A
Half asleep, wishing I still had you

[Outro]
G       D
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Bm          A
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
G       D       Bm
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
A                                       G D Bm A
I'm half asleep, wishing I still had you
