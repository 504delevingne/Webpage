<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Hello! I'm Kathleen Joyce Roldan, an 18 year old third year 
student currently taking up BS Psychology in De La Salle Universty-Dasmarinas. 
I was born on the 24th day of July on the year 1999. 
The eldest among two daughters of Hiro and Maila.

<br/>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; You're probably wondering by now, why I took the course Psychology.
Maybe because I want to read others' mind? Or probably manipulate and control them?
First of all, we don't read minds, rather, we read people's bahavior. And we do not control nor manipulate them. 
We control their behavior and understand themselves better.
Well the answer to why I took Psyhology is pretty simple and concise.
It is mainly because I want to understand other people and help them understand themselves.
And of course, undestanding myself is also a huge factor as to why I chose my hard, complicated, and worth-taking-up course, Psychlogy.
